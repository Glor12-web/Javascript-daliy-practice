🌟 Day 5: Conditional Statements (if / else)
✅ What are Conditional Statements?
They let your code make decisions based on conditions.
It’s like saying:
"If this is true, do something. Otherwise, do something else."

🔹 1. if Statement

let age = 18;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You are an adult.");
}
✔️ This prints only if the condition age >= 18 is true.

🔹 2. if...else

let age = 16;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You can vote.");
} else {
  console.log("You are too young to vote.");
}
🔹 3. else if
You can check multiple conditions:


let score = 85;

if (score >= 90) {
  console.log("A");
} else if (score >= 80) {
  console.log("B");
} else {
  console.log("C or below");
}
🔹 4. Comparison Operators
Operator	Meaning
==	Equal (value)
===	Equal (value + type)
!=	Not equal
>	Greater than
<	Less than
>=	Greater or equal
<=	Less or equal

✅ Assignment for Day 5:
Create an HTML file and inside your <script> tag:

Create a variable marks and assign it a number (e.g. 75).

Use if, else if, and else to print:

If marks >= 80, print "Excellent!"

If marks >= 60, print "Good job!"

Else print "Keep practicing!"

🌟 Bonus (Optional):
Create a variable isStudent:


let isStudent = true;
Then write:


if (isStudent) {
  console.log("You qualify for student discount.");
} else {
  console.log("You must pay full price.");
}
Let me know when you complete this and I’ll send Day 6: Logical Operators. Want a sample code for Day 5 to help you get started?
