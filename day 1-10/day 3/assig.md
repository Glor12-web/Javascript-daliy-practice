Day 3 Assignment
In an HTML file with <script>, do the following:

Declare 3 variables using let, const, and var.

Try updating them and re-declaring them (note what works and what causes errors).

Try accessing a let or const variable outside a block {} and see what happens.

Use console.log() to display your results and errors.
