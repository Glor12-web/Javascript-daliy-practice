        // i notice the differce between using for loops for array and normally
        //  for loop a condition is given and when met it stops running but for array it
        // with the length and count it then stop when there is nothing more to count


        for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            console.log('count', i) //why add a coma after the string and not just display as "count" i is it to ad space as it was not display
        } //unlike array where the assign name was called with i we just need to call the i here



        //Is there any thing important you can tell me about these two like the key point or valuable information
