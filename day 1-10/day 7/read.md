🌟 Ready for Day 7: Arrays (Lists of Data)?
📘 Lesson Note
An array is a way to store multiple values in a single variable.

let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
Arrays use index numbers to access items. Index starts from 0.


console.log(colors[0]); // red
console.log(colors[2]); // blue
🛠️ Common Array Methods
Method	What it does	Example
push()	Adds item to the end	colors.push("yellow")
pop()	Removes item from the end	colors.pop()
length	Returns the number of items	colors.length
includes()	Checks if value is in array	colors.includes("green")
indexOf()	Finds the index of an item	colors.indexOf("blue")



Let me know when you finish and I’ll drop Day 8: Loops! You’re doing amazing — keep it up! 🌱💻




Yes, your updated version is correct! You now understand that:

push() adds an item to the end of the array.

pop() removes the last item (it doesn't take any arguments).

You don’t need to use console.log() with push() or pop() unless you want to see the result or new length.

includes() checks if a value exists in the array.

indexOf() tells you the position of an item.
